# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Alexa!

I'm a Computer Science student at George Mason University. Welcome to my README! This site is my personal portfolio, where I showcase the projects I've created . I love combining design with code, and I'm always exploring new ways to make tech feel more interesting.

Feel free to explore, click around, and see what Iâ€™ve been working on!
